# ML Model Fingerprinting with CNN, DNN, Tiny LLM, and Tiny VLM

## Overview

This project explores **machine learning model fingerprinting through power and hardware profiling**.  
The system compares several model families trained on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset:

- **CNN**
- **DNN**
- **Tiny LLM**
- **Tiny VLM**

A Streamlit app allows the user to draw a digit, run inference with a selected model, and record metadata such as:

- execution time
- memory usage
- CPU usage
- GPU availability
- estimated energy consumption
- emissions information

The goal is to build a dataset of model execution signatures and use those signatures to distinguish between model architectures based on their runtime and power-related behavior.

## Quick Start (End-to-End Workflow)

This project supports **multi-device dataset collection** for building a large-scale model fingerprinting dataset.

Follow this workflow on each device, then merge everything at the end.

---

## BEFORE Data Collection (Per Device Setup)

Run these steps on **every device** before collecting data.

### 1. Get the latest code

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

### 2. Activate environment

#### Conda

```bash
conda activate fingerprinting
```

#### or venv

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Ensure trained model checkpoints exist

Expected files:

```text
checkpoints/mnist_cnn.pth
checkpoints/mnist_dnn.pth
checkpoints/mnist_tiny_llm.pth
checkpoints/mnist_tiny_vlm.pth
```

If missing, train them:

```bash
python scripts/train.py
python scripts/train_tiny_llm.py
python scripts/train_tiny_vlm.py
```

### 5. Generate model performance metrics

```bash
python scripts/generate_model_metrics.py
```

This creates:

```text
logs/model_metrics.json
```

---

## DATA COLLECTION (Per Device)

### Automated dataset generation

```bash
python scripts/generate_fingerprint_dataset.py
```

This generates:

- **1000 samples per model**
- Total: **4000 rows per run**

Saved to:

```text
logs/raw_devices/fingerprint_dataset_<device_short>_automated.csv
```

---

### Manual dataset collection (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

This allows you to draw digits and collect human-input data.

Saved to:

```text
logs/raw_devices/fingerprint_dataset_<device_short>_manual.csv
```

---

## AFTER Data Collection (Per Device)

After finishing on a device, make sure to keep:

```text
logs/raw_devices/fingerprint_dataset_<device_short>_automated.csv
logs/raw_devices/fingerprint_dataset_<device_short>_manual.csv
```

You can now move to another device and repeat the same process.

---

## AFTER ALL DEVICES (Merge Everything)

Once data has been collected from all devices:

1. Copy all dataset files into the `logs/raw_devices/` folder of a single main project

2. Run:

```bash
python scripts/merge_fingerprint_datasets.py
```

This creates:

```text
logs/merged/fingerprint_dataset_master.csv
```

---

## Final Dataset

The merged dataset includes:

- multiple model types (CNN, DNN, Tiny LLM, Tiny VLM)
- multiple devices (via `unique_device_id`)
- both collection modes:
  - `manual`
  - `automated`
- runtime + hardware + energy features

This dataset can be used for:

- model fingerprint classification
- device-based performance analysis
- energy-aware ML research
- architecture identification from runtime signals

---

## One-Line Summary

Per device:

```bash
python scripts/generate_model_metrics.py
python scripts/generate_fingerprint_dataset.py
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

After all devices:

```bash
python scripts/merge_fingerprint_datasets.py
```

---

## Project Goals

- Train multiple model families on the same digit-recognition task
- Run inference in a shared interface
- Log hardware and execution metadata during inference
- Build a structured fingerprint dataset
- Analyze whether model families can be identified from their runtime profile

## Models Included

### 1. CNN

A convolutional neural network trained on MNIST.

### 2. DNN

A fully connected neural network baseline for MNIST classification.

### 3. Tiny LLM

A small transformer-style model that tokenizes image patches and predicts the digit class.  
This is used to represent an LLM-like architecture in the fingerprinting study.

### 4. Tiny VLM

A compact vision-language model that aligns image embeddings with text prompts such as `"digit 0"` through `"digit 9"`.  
This is used to represent a multimodal architecture in the fingerprinting study.

---

## Model Performance Metrics

In addition to hardware and power-based fingerprinting data, the project also evaluates each model using standard classification and complexity metrics.

### Classification Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

### Model Complexity / Systems Metrics

- **Parameter Count**
- **FLOPs (Floating Point Operations)**
- **Execution Time**
- **Memory Footprint**
- **CPU Usage**
- **GPU Availability / Model**
- **Estimated Energy Consumption**
- **Estimated Emissions**

These metrics make it possible to compare not only how well each model predicts digits, but also how expensive each model is to run.

---

```

### Train Tiny LLM

```bash
python scripts/train_tiny_llm.py
```

### Train Tiny VLM

```bash
python scripts/train_tiny_vlm.py
```

After training, saved weights should appear in `checkpoints/`.

---

## Generating Model Metrics 

After training the models, generate evaluation and complexity metrics with:

```bash
python scripts/generate_model_metrics.py
```

This script evaluates all trained models and saves the results to:

```text
logs/model_metrics.json
```

The generated metrics include:

- accuracy
- precision
- recall
- F1 score
- confusion matrix
- parameter count
- FLOPs

These metrics are then loaded by the Streamlit app and displayed alongside inference results.

---

## Running the App

Start the Streamlit interface with:

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

The app allows the user to:

- select a model
- draw a digit
- run inference
- clear the canvas and test another number
- log fingerprint metadata
- track progress toward a target dataset size
- display model performance metrics for the selected architecture

---

## Logged Metadata

Manual and automated inference runs are saved into device-specific CSV files under:

```text
logs/raw_devices/
```

Logged runtime and fingerprinting features include:

- timestamp
- device identifier
- device short ID
- PC / host name
- collection mode (`manual` or `automated`)
- sample index (for automated runs)
- true label (for automated runs)
- model type
- number of parameters
- prediction result
- execution time
- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- memory footprint
- CPU clock speed
- GPU name
- CPU energy estimate
- GPU energy estimate
- RAM energy estimate
- total energy consumed
- total emissions

When available, each inference row can also include model-level benchmark metrics such as:

- model accuracy
- weighted precision
- weighted recall
- weighted F1 score
- FLOPs

---

## In-App Metrics Display

The Streamlit app displays model performance metrics for the currently selected model, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Parameter Count
- FLOPs
- Confusion Matrix

This allows the user to compare **predictive performance** and **systems behavior** in the same interface.

---

## Fingerprinting Dataset Collection

The project is designed to collect approximately **1000 runs per model**.  
The Streamlit sidebar tracks:

- saved dataset counts
- current session counts

This supports controlled collection of inference traces for later analysis.

For larger-scale experiments, the automated collection script can generate **4000 rows per run** (1000 per model), which can then be combined across multiple devices.

---

## Notes

- MNIST data is automatically downloaded if not already present
- Tiny LLM and Tiny VLM are lightweight proxy architectures for fingerprinting experiments
- CodeCarbon is used for emissions and energy estimation during inference
- Caching is used in the Streamlit app to improve prediction speed
- Model performance metrics are generated separately and then loaded into the app for display and logging
- Device-specific CSVs are stored separately and merged later for large-scale experiments

---

## Future Improvements

- automated batch collection of fingerprint traces
- visualization dashboard for power signatures
- classifier trained on fingerprint metadata
- support for additional model architectures
- more robust GPU and system telemetry logging
- richer visualization of confusion matrices and benchmarking summaries

## Troubleshooting

### Canvas toolbar icons look dark or hard to see

Depending on your browser/theme settings, some toolbar icons in the drawing canvas may appear darker than expected. If that happens, try switching your browser or system theme.
